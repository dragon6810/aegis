***** Important Notice *****

If your system does not have the hardware and software to play MPEG movies
in Windows, then you must first install the Video for Windows runtime player
for the movies to work.  Go to the Windows Program Manager and select FILE,
then RUN, and type "D:\VFWSETUP\SETUP" (where D is the letter of your
CD-ROM drive).  Even if you have already loaded a version of Video for
Windows, you will still need to run this setup program to load the
SuperMatch Cinepak(TM) decompressor.

Choosing the full installation in the SETUP.EXE program provides much better
performance than choosing to install just the launcher program. However,
doing so adds about 1.5 MB of files to your hard drive.

You must have Windows version 3.1 or later to use our navigational
program, though you can still use the image files on the CD in a DOS
application if you have a program that can display them.
