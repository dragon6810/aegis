Thank you for trying out the demo copy of Image Alchemy.


To install Image Alchemy copy all the files from this diskette onto a
sub-directory on your hard drive.


The documentation for Image Alchemy is contained in ALCHEMY.DOC.  This
file may be printed on a printer or viewed using a text editor.

Please be aware that the ALCHEMY.DOC file is over 150 pages long; you
might want to save paper and only print those sections that you need. 
For best results when printing use a 12 point fixed space font, and
make sure that your printer is set to not ignore formfeeds.

The file ADDENDUM.DOC contains an addendum of changes that were made to
Image Alchemy after the manual was written.
