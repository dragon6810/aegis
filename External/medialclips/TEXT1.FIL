Info: Completed in 1902, the Flatiron Building (originally the Fuller Building) is built on the narrow triangle formed by the convergence of 5th Avenue and Broadway. Only six feet wide at 23rd Street, early New Yorkers feared the Flatiron Building would blow over in a heavy wind. It was the first skyscraper to grace the skyline of New York City and ushered in a dramatic new architectural era.

Info: The granite faces of Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln were carved from a 6,000 foot mountain by Gutzon Borglum. He worked on this monument from 1927 until his death in 1941. Borglum originally intended to carve full figure likenesses of the presidents, but the faces alone seemed monumental enough.

File: AK3 Masai Giraffe
Disc: Animal Kingdom
Title: Masai Giraffe
Information: The Masai giraffe, the type shown in this photo, is the more common of the two varieties found in central East Africa (the other type is the reticulated giraffe). The main difference between the two is in the coloration and pattern of spots. The Masai giraffe has lighter star shaped spots, while the reticulated giraffe is a deep brown and has an intricate tortoiseshell pattern covering its body. Giraffes are the tallest living animals, reaching heights of up to twenty feet. Although giraffes have long necks, they have exactly the same number of vertebrae as humans, seven. Both males and females have horns which are really nothing more than small projections of bone covered by skin and hair. Like the elephant, giraffes travel in herds sometimes numbering over forty individuals, led by either an old bull giraffe, or a female when moving. Giraffes feed only on plants, using their prehensile upper lip and lengthy tongue to gather food. The Swahili name for giraffe, twiga, is the same for both the reticulated and Masai giraffe.

The public didn't know of this military aircraft until November 1988.  The Stealth Fighter was only flown at night from its secret air base, in a remote corner of Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada.  The pilots who fly the F-117A have nicknamed it the "Black Jet."

The Lancaster was adapted to go on some very unusual bombing missions. For example, it was used to blow up German dams by dropping bombs that skipped like stones across the water. When the bombs reached the side of the dams they sank to the bottom, then exploded.

The shadows of Saturn's three bright rings and Tethys are cast onto the cloud tops. The limb of the planet can be seen easily through the 3500-kilometer-wide (2170 miles) Cassini Division, which separates ring A from ring B. The view through the much narrower Encke Division, near the outer edge of ring A is less clear. Beyond the Encke Division (at left) is the faintest of Saturn's three bright rings, the C ring or crepe ring, barely visible against the planet. The Voyager Project is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA.
